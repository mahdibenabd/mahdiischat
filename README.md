# Chat GPT (Mahdiischat)
Chat GPT is a simple web-based chat application that utilizes the OpenAI API for natural language processing. It allows users to interact with an AI-powered chatbot using both text input and speech recognition.

# Features
- **Text Input**: Users can type messages in the input box and send them to the chatbot.
- **Speech Recognition**: Users can enable speech recognition to convert their spoken words into text input for the chatbot.
- **Text-to-Speech**: The chatbot's responses can be converted into spoken words using text-to-speech synthesis.
- **Language Selection**: Users can choose from a variety of languages for both input and output.
- **Model Selection**: Different OpenAI models can be selected for generating chatbot responses.
# Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/mahdibenabd/chat-gpt.git
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

**Ensure you have an OpenAI API key. If not, sign up for the OpenAI API and replace the placeholder API key in ChatGPT.js with your actual key.**

Start interacting with the chatbot by typing messages or enabling speech recognition.

# Usage
Type your message in the input box and press "Send" to send it to the chatbot.
Optionally, check the "Listen" box to enable speech recognition and speak your message instead.
The chatbot's responses will be displayed in the output box and can be heard if text-to-speech is enabled.
